**Solve reCAPTCHA v2, reCAPTCHA v3, Cloudflare Turnstile, GeeTest and image captchas from PHP.**

Official PHP client for [CapSkip](https://capskip.com), a **local captcha solver** that runs on your own machine. Licensed once, not billed per solve.

```bash
composer require capskip/capskip
```

---

## How it works

CapSkip is a desktop app. It does the solving on your machine and exposes the standard captcha-solver HTTP API — the same `in.php` / `res.php` endpoints every 2captcha-compatible client already speaks — on `127.0.0.1:8080`.

This SDK is a thin wrapper over that API, with the method names you would expect: `normal()`, `recaptcha()`, `turnstile()`, `geetest()`. Nothing leaves your network, and there is no credit balance to keep an eye on.

## Supported captcha types

| Captcha | Method |
|---|---|
| **Image captcha solver** (distorted text / OCR) | `$solver->normal($file)` |
| **reCAPTCHA v2 solver** (checkbox) | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url)` |
| **reCAPTCHA v2 invisible solver** | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url, ['invisible' => 1])` |
| **reCAPTCHA Enterprise solver** | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url, ['enterprise' => 1])` |
| **reCAPTCHA v3 solver** | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url, ['version' => 'v3', 'action' => 'submit'])` |
| reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url, ['version' => 'v3', 'enterprise' => 1])` |
| **Cloudflare Turnstile solver** (widget) | `$solver->turnstile($sitekey, $url)` |
| Cloudflare Turnstile (challenge page) | `$solver->turnstile($sitekey, $url, ['data' => ..., 'pagedata' => ...])` |
| **GeeTest v3 solver** (slide puzzle) | `$solver->geetest($gt, $challenge, $url)` |

**hCaptcha and FunCaptcha/Arkose are not supported.** hCaptcha is the one people misidentify most often, since it also puts a `data-sitekey` on the widget — check for `class="h-captcha"` or a `js.hcaptcha.com` script before reaching for `recaptcha()`.

Point the SDK at the [live captcha demo pages](https://capskip.com/captcha-demo/) to sanity-check your setup against real widgets.

## Quick start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install the CapSkip captcha solver

Download and run the CapSkip desktop app from [capskip.com](https://capskip.com/download/). Leave it running in the background.

In CapSkip settings, note:

- **API port** (default: `8080`)
- **API key** (optional — if validation is disabled, any string works)

### 2. Install the SDK

```bash
composer require capskip/capskip
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/capskip/capskip-php.git
cd capskip-php
composer install
```

### 3. Solve your first captcha

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use CapSkip\CapSkip;

$solver = new CapSkip(['host' => '127.0.0.1', 'port' => 8080]);

$result = $solver->recaptcha(
    'YOUR_SITEKEY',
    'https://example.com/page-with-recaptcha'
);

echo $result['code']; // g-recaptcha-response token
```

> **Prerequisite:** CapSkip must be running before you call the SDK. If you see a connection error, see [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Why solve captchas locally

Cloud captcha APIs charge per solve, which turns a retry loop into an expense and routes every page URL and sitekey you touch through someone else's queue.

CapSkip flips that around:

- **Unlimited solving** — one license, no per-captcha charge, no balance to top up
- **Runs on `127.0.0.1`** — the SDK never talks to a third-party server
- **No per-key rate limit** — throughput is whatever your machine can manage
- **Fast** — image captchas come back in well under a second; a typical reCAPTCHA v2 lands in 30–45 seconds

### Coming from 2captcha or Anti-Captcha

CapSkip answers on the same `in.php` / `res.php` endpoints, so it works as a **2captcha API alternative**: an existing integration usually needs nothing more than its host pointed at `127.0.0.1:8080`. The [migration notes](https://capskip.com/2captcha-api-alternative/) cover the details, if you would rather keep your current client library than switch to this one.

## Configuration

```php
use CapSkip\CapSkip;

$solver = new CapSkip([
    'apiKey' => 'capskip',        // your CapSkip API key (or any string if validation is off)
    'host' => '127.0.0.1',        // CapSkip host
    'port' => 8080,               // CapSkip port from app settings
    'defaultTimeout' => 120,      // seconds — image captcha polling timeout
    'recaptchaTimeout' => 300,    // seconds — reCAPTCHA / Turnstile / GeeTest polling timeout
    'pollingInterval' => 5,       // max seconds between res.php polls (starts at 0.25s, backs off to this)
]);
```

Use environment variables in production:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
export CAPSKIP_API_KEY="your-key"
export CAPSKIP_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export CAPSKIP_PORT="8080"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:CAPSKIP_API_KEY = "your-key"
$env:CAPSKIP_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
$env:CAPSKIP_PORT = "8080"
```

```php
use CapSkip\CapSkip;

$solver = new CapSkip([
    'apiKey' => getenv('CAPSKIP_API_KEY') ?: 'capskip',
    'host' => getenv('CAPSKIP_HOST') ?: '127.0.0.1',
    'port' => (int) (getenv('CAPSKIP_PORT') ?: 8080),
]);
```

## Usage examples

### Image captcha

```php
$result = $solver->normal('captcha.png');
$result = $solver->normal('https://example.com/captcha.jpg');
$result = $solver->normal('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...');
echo $result['code'];
```

### reCAPTCHA v2 / v3

```php
// reCAPTCHA v2
$v2 = $solver->recaptcha('...', 'https://example.com');

// reCAPTCHA v3
$v3 = $solver->recaptcha('...', 'https://example.com', [
    'version' => 'v3',
    'action' => 'submit',
    'score' => 0.7,
]);
```

### Cloudflare Turnstile

```php
$result = $solver->turnstile('0x4AAAAAAA...', 'https://example.com');
```

### GeeTest v3

`$gt` is static per site, but `$challenge` is single-use and expires in about a
minute — fetch a fresh pair right before solving.

```php
$result = $solver->geetest(
    '81388ea1fc187e0c335c0a8907ff2625',
    '7cf6a8b1a2c34d5e6f7089abcdef0123',
    'https://example.com/login'
);

// Post these back exactly as the site's own front-end would
$result['challenge']; $result['validate']; $result['seccode'];
```

### With a proxy (reCAPTCHA, Turnstile & GeeTest only)

```php
// Proxy is not supported for image captcha
$result = $solver->recaptcha('...', 'https://example.com', [
    'proxy' => ['type' => 'HTTPS', 'uri' => 'user:pass@1.2.3.4:3128'],
]);
$result = $solver->turnstile('...', 'https://example.com', [
    'proxy' => ['type' => 'HTTP', 'uri' => '1.2.3.4:3128'],
]);
```

### Solving several captchas

```php
use CapSkip\CapSkip;

$solver = new CapSkip();
$r1 = $solver->recaptcha('...', 'https://a.com');
$r2 = $solver->turnstile('...', 'https://b.com');
echo $r1['code'], $r2['code'];
```

> PHP executes synchronously, so each solve blocks until it finishes. `AsyncCapSkip` is exported as an alias of `CapSkip` for parity with the other CapSkip SDKs — code ported from them keeps working unchanged.

## Laravel, Guzzle and Symfony Panther

The SDK hands back a token; the rest of your stack does what it already does.

**In a Laravel app**, resolve the solver from the container and treat a solve like any other outbound call:

```php
$this->app->singleton(CapSkip::class, fn () => new CapSkip([
    'apiKey' => config('services.capskip.key'),
    'host' => config('services.capskip.host', '127.0.0.1'),
]));
```

**Posting the token with Guzzle** — the field name is whatever the target form uses; for reCAPTCHA it is `g-recaptcha-response`:

```php
$token = $solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url)['code'];

$client->post($url, ['form_params' => [
    'g-recaptcha-response' => $token,
    // ... the rest of the form
]]);
```

**Driving a real browser with Symfony Panther** (or php-webdriver/Selenium), read the sitekey off the page, solve, then write the token back:

```php
$sitekey = $crawler->filter('[data-sitekey]')->attr('data-sitekey');
$token = $solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $client->getCurrentURL())['code'];

$client->executeScript(
    'document.getElementById("g-recaptcha-response").value = arguments[0];', [$token]
);
```

Longer walkthroughs: [Selenium](https://capskip.com/selenium-captcha-solver/) and the [PHP captcha solver guide](https://capskip.com/php-captcha-solver/).

---

## Return value

Every solve method returns an associative array:

```php
[
    'captchaId' => '12345',   // internal ID from CapSkip
    'code' => 'TOKEN_OR_TEXT', // solution — text for image, token for reCAPTCHA/Turnstile
    'userAgent' => '...',      // Turnstile only — use when submitting challenge-page tokens
]
```

GeeTest additionally expands its answer into `challenge`, `validate`, and
`seccode`, while `code` keeps the raw JSON string.

---

## Error handling

```php
use CapSkip\CapSkip;
use CapSkip\Exceptions\ValidationException;
use CapSkip\Exceptions\NetworkException;
use CapSkip\Exceptions\ApiException;
use CapSkip\Exceptions\TimeoutException;

try {
    $result = $solver->recaptcha('...', '...');
} catch (ValidationException $e) {
    // invalid parameters
} catch (NetworkException $e) {
    // CapSkip not running, or captcha not ready (manual polling)
} catch (ApiException $e) {
    // API returned an error code
} catch (TimeoutException $e) {
    // polling timeout exceeded
}
```

All four extend `CapSkip\Exceptions\CapSkipError`, so you can catch them all at once with the base class.

## FAQ

### How do I solve a captcha in PHP?

Install the CapSkip desktop app, `composer require capskip/capskip`, then call the method that matches the widget — `recaptcha()`, `turnstile()`, `geetest()` or `normal()`. Each one blocks until CapSkip has an answer, then returns a token, or the recognized text in the case of an image captcha.

### Is this a free captcha solver?

The SDK itself is MIT-licensed and free. Solving needs the CapSkip app, which is bought once rather than metered per captcha, so your cost stops scaling with volume.

### Which captchas can it solve?

reCAPTCHA v2 (checkbox and invisible), reCAPTCHA v3, reCAPTCHA Enterprise, Cloudflare Turnstile, GeeTest v3, and image/text captchas. Not hCaptcha, and not FunCaptcha/Arkose.

### Does it work with Laravel, Guzzle or Symfony?

Yes — see [above](#laravel-guzzle-and-symfony-panther). The SDK has no framework ties and depends only on `ext-curl` and `ext-json`, so it drops into any PHP 8 project.

### Why is my reCAPTCHA v3 score low?

Google derives v3 scores from IP reputation, cookies and browsing history. A solver returns a valid token, but it cannot change how Google grades that token — `score` is forwarded as the target you want, not a guarantee. If a site enforces a high threshold, solve through a cleaner IP using the `proxy` option.

### Can I use it as a 2captcha alternative?

Yes. CapSkip serves the same endpoints, so you can either move to this SDK or repoint an existing 2captcha client at `127.0.0.1:8080`.

### Does the captcha have to be on a public page?

For widget captchas, yes — CapSkip loads the URL you pass it. Image captchas only need the image, and that can be a local file.

### Will a long solve time out my PHP request?

It can. A reCAPTCHA solve takes tens of seconds, which is longer than most `max_execution_time` settings and longer than a user will wait on a page load. Solve from a queue worker or CLI script rather than inside a web request.
