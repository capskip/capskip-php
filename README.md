**Solve reCAPTCHA v2, reCAPTCHA v3, Cloudflare Turnstile, GeeTest, ALTCHA, Capy Puzzle, CaptchaFox, Friendly Captcha, AWS WAF, DataDome, hCaptcha, MTCaptcha and image captchas from PHP.**

Official PHP client for [CapSkip](https://capskip.com), a **local captcha solver** that runs on your own machine. Licensed once, not billed per solve.

```bash
composer require capskip/capskip
```

---

## How it works

CapSkip is a desktop app. It does the solving on your machine and exposes the standard captcha-solver HTTP API — the same `in.php` / `res.php` endpoints every 2captcha-compatible client already speaks — on `127.0.0.1:8080`.

This SDK is a thin wrapper over that API, with the method names you would expect: `normal()`, `recaptcha()`, `turnstile()`, `geetest()`, `altcha()`, `capy()`, `captchafox()`, `friendlyCaptcha()`, `amazonWaf()`, `dataDome()`, `hcaptcha()`, `mtcaptcha()`. Nothing leaves your network, and there is no credit balance to keep an eye on.

## Supported captcha types

| Captcha | Method |
|---|---|
| **Image captcha solver** (distorted text / OCR) | `$solver->normal($file)` |
| **reCAPTCHA v2 solver** (checkbox) | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url)` |
| **reCAPTCHA v2 invisible solver** | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url, ['invisible' => 1])` |
| **reCAPTCHA Enterprise solver** | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url, ['enterprise' => 1])` |
| **reCAPTCHA v3 solver** | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url, ['version' => 'v3', 'action' => 'submit'])` |
| reCAPTCHA v3 Enterprise | `$solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url, ['version' => 'v3', 'enterprise' => 1])` |
| **Cloudflare Turnstile solver** (widget) | `$solver->turnstile($sitekey, $url)` |
| Cloudflare Turnstile (challenge page) | `$solver->turnstile($sitekey, $url, ['data' => ..., 'pagedata' => ...])` |
| **GeeTest v3 solver** (slide puzzle) | `$solver->geetest($gt, $challenge, $url)` |
| **ALTCHA solver** (proof-of-work) | `$solver->altcha($url, [...])` |
| **Capy Puzzle solver** (slide puzzle) | `$solver->capy($sitekey, $url)` |
| **CaptchaFox solver** (widget) | `$solver->captchafox($sitekey, $url)` |
| **Friendly Captcha solver** (proof-of-work) | `$solver->friendlyCaptcha($sitekey, $url, ['version' => 'v2'])` |
| **AWS WAF solver** (challenge page or widget) | `$solver->amazonWaf($sitekey, $url, [...])` |
| **DataDome solver** (slider and device check) | `$solver->dataDome($captchaUrl, $url)` |
| **hCaptcha solver** (checkbox, invisible and Enterprise) | `$solver->hcaptcha($sitekey, $url)` |
| **MTCaptcha solver** (text captcha) | `$solver->mtcaptcha($sitekey, $url)` |

**FunCaptcha/Arkose is not supported.** hCaptcha and reCAPTCHA both put a `data-sitekey` on the widget, so tell them apart before choosing a method: `class="h-captcha"` or a `js.hcaptcha.com` script means `hcaptcha()`, `class="g-recaptcha"` means `recaptcha()`.

Point the SDK at the [live captcha demo pages](https://capskip.com/captcha-demo/) to sanity-check your setup against real widgets.

## Quick start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install the CapSkip captcha solver

Download and run the CapSkip desktop app from the [download page](https://capskip.com/download-capskip/). Leave it running in the background.

In CapSkip settings, note:

- **API port** (default: `8080`)
- **API key** (optional — if validation is disabled, any string works)

### 2. Install the SDK

```bash
composer require capskip/capskip
```

Or from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/capskip/capskip-php.git
cd capskip-php
composer install
```

### 3. Solve your first captcha

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use CapSkip\CapSkip;

$solver = new CapSkip(['host' => '127.0.0.1', 'port' => 8080]);

$result = $solver->recaptcha(
    'YOUR_SITEKEY',
    'https://example.com/page-with-recaptcha'
);

echo $result['code']; // g-recaptcha-response token
```

> **Prerequisite:** CapSkip must be running before you call the SDK. If you see a connection error, see [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

---

## Why solve captchas locally

Cloud captcha APIs charge per solve, which turns a retry loop into an expense and routes every page URL and sitekey you touch through someone else's queue.

CapSkip flips that around:

- **Unlimited solving** — one license, no per-captcha charge, no balance to top up
- **Runs on `127.0.0.1`** — the SDK never talks to a third-party server
- **No per-key rate limit** — throughput is whatever your machine can manage
- **Fast** — image captchas come back in well under a second; a typical reCAPTCHA v2 lands in 30–45 seconds

### Coming from 2captcha or Anti-Captcha

CapSkip answers on the same `in.php` / `res.php` endpoints, so it works as a **2captcha API alternative**: an existing integration usually needs nothing more than its host pointed at `127.0.0.1:8080`. The [migration notes](https://capskip.com/2captcha-api-alternative/) cover the details, if you would rather keep your current client library than switch to this one.

## Configuration

```php
use CapSkip\CapSkip;

$solver = new CapSkip([
    'apiKey' => 'capskip',        // your CapSkip API key (or any string if validation is off)
    'host' => '127.0.0.1',        // CapSkip host
    'port' => 8080,               // CapSkip port from app settings
    'defaultTimeout' => 120,      // seconds — image captcha, ALTCHA, Capy and MTCaptcha polling timeout
    'recaptchaTimeout' => 300,    // seconds — reCAPTCHA / Turnstile / GeeTest / CaptchaFox /
                                  // Friendly Captcha / AWS WAF / DataDome / hCaptcha polling timeout
                                  // (ALTCHA, Capy and MTCaptcha use defaultTimeout — none is a browser solve)
    'pollingInterval' => 5,       // max seconds between res.php polls (starts at 0.25s, backs off to this)
]);
```

Use environment variables in production:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
export CAPSKIP_API_KEY="your-key"
export CAPSKIP_HOST="127.0.0.1"
export CAPSKIP_PORT="8080"
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:CAPSKIP_API_KEY = "your-key"
$env:CAPSKIP_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
$env:CAPSKIP_PORT = "8080"
```

```php
use CapSkip\CapSkip;

$solver = new CapSkip([
    'apiKey' => getenv('CAPSKIP_API_KEY') ?: 'capskip',
    'host' => getenv('CAPSKIP_HOST') ?: '127.0.0.1',
    'port' => (int) (getenv('CAPSKIP_PORT') ?: 8080),
]);
```

---

## Usage examples

### Image captcha

```php
$result = $solver->normal('captcha.png');
$result = $solver->normal('https://example.com/captcha.jpg');
$result = $solver->normal('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...');
echo $result['code'];
```

### reCAPTCHA v2 / v3

```php
// reCAPTCHA v2
$v2 = $solver->recaptcha('...', 'https://example.com');

// reCAPTCHA v3
$v3 = $solver->recaptcha('...', 'https://example.com', [
    'version' => 'v3',
    'action' => 'submit',
    'score' => 0.7,
]);
```

### Cloudflare Turnstile

```php
$result = $solver->turnstile('0x4AAAAAAA...', 'https://example.com');
```

### GeeTest v3

`$gt` is static per site, but `$challenge` is single-use and expires in about a
minute — fetch a fresh pair right before solving.

```php
$result = $solver->geetest(
    '81388ea1fc187e0c335c0a8907ff2625',
    '7cf6a8b1a2c34d5e6f7089abcdef0123',
    'https://example.com/login'
);

// Post these back exactly as the site's own front-end would
$result['challenge']; $result['validate']; $result['seccode'];
```

### ALTCHA

ALTCHA is proof-of-work, not recognition — there is nothing to read, so a solve
is deterministic and takes milliseconds. Give CapSkip the endpoint that serves
the challenge, or the challenge document itself.

```php
$result = $solver->altcha('https://example.com/signup', [
    'challenge_url' => 'https://example.com/captcha/api/altcha/challenge',
]);

// Post this back in the form field the widget uses, named `altcha`
$result['token'];
```

Challenges expire fast — some sites inside two minutes — so fetch one
immediately before solving and submit the token promptly.

### Capy Puzzle

A Capy solution is not a token. It is three values that together go into the
target form, so post all three back exactly as returned.

```php
$result = $solver->capy(
    'PUZZLE_Abc1dEFghIJKLM2no34P56q7rStu8v',
    'https://example.com/login'
);

// capy_captchakey, capy_challengekey and capy_answer respectively
$result['captchakey'];
$result['challengekey'];
$result['answer'];
```

`answer` is the drag path the widget would have recorded — submit it verbatim,
without trimming or re-encoding it. The challenge key is single-use and
short-lived, so submit promptly rather than caching the three values.

Pass `api_server` when the widget script points somewhere other than
`https://jp.api.capy.me`. Only the `puzzle` family is solved; `'version' =>
'avatar'` is refused rather than answered with a puzzle answer the site would
reject.

### CaptchaFox

```php
$result = $solver->captchafox(
    'sk_xtNxpk6fCdFbxh1_xJeGflSdCE9tn99G',
    'https://example.com/signup'
);

// Post this back in the form field the widget uses, named `cf-captcha-response`
$result['token'];

// The UA the token was minted under — submit under this one, not your own
$result['userAgent'] ?? null;
```

`$url` has to be the page the widget actually runs on: CaptchaFox checks it
against the domains the key is registered for and refuses a mismatch
permanently, not intermittently.

Pass `api_server` only when the page does not load the default widget. A page
loading the MAM package expects a `MAM_` prefixed token, and sending the wrong
source still succeeds — it just returns a token the site will not accept, which
reads as a silent verification failure rather than an error.

### Friendly Captcha

Two different protocols ship under this name and a sitekey does not tell you
which one a site uses, so say which — or send the widget script and let CapSkip
read it off the build the site actually loads.

```php
$result = $solver->friendlyCaptcha(
    'FCMGEMUD2M567T8G',
    'https://example.com/signup',
    ['version' => 'v2']
);

// v1 → frc-captcha-solution, v2 → frc-captcha-response
$result['token'];
```

```php
// Or let the script URL decide the version
$result = $solver->friendlyCaptcha(
    'FCMGEMUD2M567T8G',
    'https://example.com/signup',
    ['module_script' => 'https://cdn.example.com/@friendlycaptcha/sdk@0.1.6/site.min.js']
);
```

Solving the wrong version returns a well-formed token the target site rejects,
with nothing to indicate the version was the problem. With neither `version` nor
a script URL, v1 is assumed. Pass `'api_server' => 'eu'` for a sitekey on the EU
data-residency tenant. A v2 token is roughly six kilobytes, so size whatever
carries it accordingly.

### AWS WAF

An AWS WAF solution is not a token either. It is two values, `captcha_voucher`
and `existing_token`, that only work as a pair. There are two kinds of page.

**Challenge page** (the HTTP 405 page that sets `window.gokuProps`): `$sitekey` is
`gokuProps.key`, and `iv` and `context` are `gokuProps.iv` and `gokuProps.context`.

```php
$result = $solver->amazonWaf(
    'AQIDAHjcYuEXAMPLEghicBgQ/7bFaQZ+m5FKCMDnO+vTbNg96AHDh0IR5vgzHNceHYqZR+GOAAAAfjB8',
    'https://example.com/',
    [
        'iv' => 'CgAFRDIjfgAAA5yY',
        'context' => 'Rbp3r8fvbuhmrCqpUe8Mh1TLvs8OSKJZiSs2vCF4dt9rxVZI7xYJa2n5k/9r+XaXe7KUIu2I8nXTDHHkDvIOTDc2',
        'challenge_script' => 'https://3f2a9c7d41b0.edge.sdk.awswaf.com/3f2a9c7d41b0/8e51d0c7a2f4/challenge.js',
    ]
);

$result['captcha_voucher'];
$result['existing_token'];
```

`iv` and `context` are optional, but they travel together: send both or
neither. Left out, CapSkip reads them from the page at solve time, which is the
safer choice when your copy of the page is more than a few minutes old.

**Widget page** (`AwsWafCaptcha.renderCaptcha`): `$sitekey` is the widget's
`apiKey`, and `jsapiScript` is the full URL of `jsapi.js`. No `iv` or `context`.

```php
$result = $solver->amazonWaf(
    'Xr9kEXAMPLE2bWQx1vTq8LmZ0aYc4dHs7nFp3gJt6uKw5eRi9AbCdEfGh=_0_1',
    'https://example.com/signup',
    ['jsapiScript' => 'https://5b7e0a19c3d8.us-east-1.captcha-sdk.awswaf.com/5b7e0a19c3d8/jsapi.js']
);
```

To turn the pair into the `aws-waf-token` cookie, POST it as JSON to the
`voucher` endpoint beside the page's `challenge.js` (same directory, file name
`voucher`). The response's `token` is the cookie value. Exchange the pair as
soon as it arrives rather than storing it for later.

Every script URL (`challenge_script`, `captcha_script`, `jsapiScript`) has to be
an https URL on an `awswaf.com` host, ending in `challenge.js`, `captcha.js` or
`jsapi.js`. Anything else is refused before the request is sent, because it is
not an AWS WAF integration.

### DataDome

DataDome answers a request it doubts with a block page (status 403, sometimes
401) instead of the site. CapSkip passes the challenge on that page, a slider
or a device check, and returns the `datadome` cookie that lets your requests
through. The arguments follow 2Captcha's `datadome(captcha_url, pageurl,
userAgent, proxy)` order, but `userAgent` and `proxy` are optional and go in
`$options`.

```php
$result = $solver->dataDome(
    'https://geo.captcha-delivery.com/captcha/?initialCid=...&hash=...&cid=...&t=fe&referer=...&s=45225&e=...&dm=cd',
    'https://www.example.com/',                    // the page that returned the block page
    [
        'userAgent' => 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 '
            . '(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/156.0.0.0 Safari/537.36',
        'proxy' => ['type' => 'HTTP', 'uri' => 'login:password@203.0.113.10:8080'],
    ]
);

$result['cookie'];          // "datadome=..." -- send it as the Cookie header
$result['code'];            // the cookie exactly as DataDome set it: Max-Age, Domain, Path...
$result['userAgent'];       // the User-Agent the cookie was earned with
$result['proxy'] ?? null;   // set only when CapSkip picked the proxy, see below
```

`$captchaUrl` is the address of the challenge iframe on
`geo.captcha-delivery.com`: `/captcha/` for a slider, `/interstitial/` for a
device check. Take the iframe's `src` when the block page has one; most build it
with a script instead, so assemble it from the page's `var dd={...}` object as
the [API docs](https://capskip.com/api-docs/#datadome) show. Each block page is
a fresh challenge, so submit it soon and fetch the page again for the next task.

**The cookie belongs to one IP address and one browser.** DataDome refuses it
from any other address, or with any other User-Agent, so:

- **Send the User-Agent you will use**, or none. It must be Chrome for Windows,
  with the same major version as the browser CapSkip solves with; anything else
  (Firefox, Safari, Edge, mobile, macOS) would earn a cookie the site rejects,
  so it is refused before the request is sent, and a different Chrome major is
  refused by CapSkip with `ERROR_WRONG_USERAGENT`. Send none and CapSkip uses
  its own browser's: copy `$result['userAgent']` into your requests as it is.
- **Solve from the address you will use the cookie from.** If your requests go
  out through a proxy, pass that proxy with the task. If they come from the
  machine running CapSkip, pass none.
- **When CapSkip picks the proxy, it tells you which.** The CapSkip app has a
  DataDome proxy list of its own (Settings, Captcha types, DataDome, Configure
  Proxies). A task sent without a proxy is solved through that list, and the
  result then carries `proxy` as `host:port`: send the cookie through that
  proxy, or it will be refused. A proxy you send always takes priority over
  the list, and then no `proxy` comes back.

```php
$ch = curl_init('https://www.example.com/');
curl_setopt_array($ch, [
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
    CURLOPT_USERAGENT => $result['userAgent'],
    CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => ['Cookie: ' . $result['cookie']],
]);
if (isset($result['proxy'])) {
    // The list's proxy, named without its login: add your credentials if it has one.
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_PROXY, 'http://' . $result['proxy']);
}
$page = curl_exec($ch);
```

A block page whose `dd` object carries `'t':'bv'` means DataDome has banned the
address that fetched it; no solve from there can pass, so it is refused before
the request is sent. Change the address and request the page again.

### hCaptcha

hCaptcha is the checkbox widget behind many sign-up, login and checkout forms.
CapSkip passes the widget for the sitekey and page you send and returns the
token. The arguments follow 2Captcha's `hcaptcha(sitekey, pageurl, ...)`, with
the optional ones in `$options`, and invisible and Enterprise widgets use the
same method.

```php
$result = $solver->hcaptcha(
    'a5f74b19-9e45-40e0-b45d-47ff91b7a6c2',   // data-sitekey of the widget
    'https://accounts.hcaptcha.com/demo',     // the page the widget is on
    [
        // 'invisible' => 1,                  // for a widget with data-size="invisible"
        // 'data' => '...',                   // hCaptcha Enterprise: the rqdata the page passes to hcaptcha.setData()
        // 'userAgent' => 'Mozilla/5.0 ...',  // the User-Agent you will submit the form with
        // 'proxy' => ['type' => 'HTTP', 'uri' => 'login:password@203.0.113.10:8080'],
    ]
);

$result['token'];      // put it in h-captcha-response (and g-recaptcha-response, if present)
$result['respKey'];    // the second value hCaptcha hands the widget; usually empty or unused
$result['userAgent'];  // the User-Agent the token was earned with
```

The sitekey is on the widget container as `data-sitekey`, in the `sitekey`
option of `hcaptcha.render()`, or in the `sitekey=` parameter of the hCaptcha
iframe's address. An Enterprise `rqdata` value is issued for one challenge and
expires quickly, so read a fresh one for every task. `invisible` takes `1` or
`true` (and `0` or `false`, which is the same as leaving it out).

Put the token in the form's `h-captcha-response` field (and `g-recaptcha-response`,
if the form has one), or pass it to the widget's `data-callback`, and submit with
the User-Agent from the result. Tokens are single use and expire about two
minutes after they are issued, so submit each one soon.

```php
$ch = curl_init('https://www.example.com/signup');
curl_setopt_array($ch, [
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
    CURLOPT_USERAGENT => $result['userAgent'],
    CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => http_build_query([
        'email' => 'someone@example.com',
        'h-captcha-response' => $result['token'],
        'g-recaptcha-response' => $result['token'],
    ]),
]);
$page = curl_exec($ch);
```

A `userAgent` you send is used only when it matches the browser CapSkip solves
with; the result always names the one the token was actually earned with. At
volume, hCaptcha scores the network a token comes from as well as the browser,
so send a proxy with each task or configure a pool in the CapSkip app (Settings,
Captcha types, hCaptcha, Configure Proxies). If a strict site still refuses the
tokens, turn on High score mode for hCaptcha in the same settings page.

### MTCaptcha

MTCaptcha is a text captcha used on login, sign-up and contact forms: the
visitor types the distorted characters in a picture and the widget puts a
verified token into the form. CapSkip takes the sitekey and page address and
returns that token. The arguments follow 2Captcha's
`mtcaptcha(sitekey, url, ...)`, with the optional ones in `$options`.

```php
$result = $solver->mtcaptcha(
    'MTPublic-KzqLY1cKH',                      // from the page's mtcaptchaConfig
    'https://2captcha.com/demo/mtcaptcha',     // the page the widget is on
    [
        // 'action' => 'login',               // the action mtcaptchaConfig sets, if it sets one
        // 'userAgent' => 'Mozilla/5.0 ...',  // the User-Agent to present to MTCaptcha
        // 'proxy' => ['type' => 'HTTP', 'uri' => 'login:password@203.0.113.10:8080'],
    ]
);

$result['token'];   // v1(...) -- put it in the mtcaptcha-verifiedtoken field
```

The sitekey starts with `MTPublic-`. Most pages set it in a `mtcaptchaConfig`
object in the page source; when the widget is on screen it is also the `sitekey`
query parameter of its iframe on `service.mtcaptcha.com`. A key copied from the
widget's own `getchallenge` request as `sk=MTPublic-...` is accepted too.
MTCaptcha issues tokens only for the domains the sitekey is registered for, so
send the real page address.

```php
$ch = curl_init('https://www.example.com/login');
curl_setopt_array($ch, [
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
    CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => http_build_query([
        'email' => 'someone@example.com',
        'mtcaptcha-verifiedtoken' => $result['token'],
    ]),
]);
$page = curl_exec($ch);
```

No browser runs for this solve, so it uses `defaultTimeout`. Every solve asks
MTCaptcha's service for fresh challenges, so at volume configure a proxy pool in
the CapSkip app (Settings, Captcha types, MTCaptcha, Configure Proxies) or send a
proxy with each task.

### With a proxy (every method except image captcha)

```php
// Proxy is not supported for image captcha
$result = $solver->recaptcha('...', 'https://example.com', [
    'proxy' => ['type' => 'HTTPS', 'uri' => 'user:pass@1.2.3.4:3128'],
]);
$result = $solver->turnstile('...', 'https://example.com', [
    'proxy' => ['type' => 'HTTP', 'uri' => '1.2.3.4:3128'],
]);
```

### Solving several captchas

```php
use CapSkip\CapSkip;

$solver = new CapSkip();
$r1 = $solver->recaptcha('...', 'https://a.com');
$r2 = $solver->turnstile('...', 'https://b.com');
echo $r1['code'], $r2['code'];
```

> PHP executes synchronously, so each solve blocks until it finishes. `AsyncCapSkip` is exported as an alias of `CapSkip` for parity with the other CapSkip SDKs — code ported from them keeps working unchanged.

## Laravel, Guzzle and Symfony Panther

The SDK hands back a token; the rest of your stack does what it already does.

**In a Laravel app**, resolve the solver from the container and treat a solve like any other outbound call:

```php
$this->app->singleton(CapSkip::class, fn () => new CapSkip([
    'apiKey' => config('services.capskip.key'),
    'host' => config('services.capskip.host', '127.0.0.1'),
]));
```

**Posting the token with Guzzle** — the field name is whatever the target form uses; for reCAPTCHA it is `g-recaptcha-response`:

```php
$token = $solver->recaptcha($sitekey, $url)['code'];

$client->post($url, ['form_params' => [
    'g-recaptcha-response' => $token,
    // ... the rest of the form
]]);
```

**Driving a real browser with Symfony Panther** (or php-webdriver/Selenium), read the sitekey off the page, solve, then write the token back:

```php

## Return value

Every solve method returns an associative array:

```php
[
    'captchaId' => '12345',   // internal ID from CapSkip
    'code' => 'TOKEN_OR_TEXT', // solution — text for image, token for reCAPTCHA/Turnstile
    'userAgent' => '...',      // Turnstile only — use when submitting challenge-page tokens
]
```

ALTCHA adds `token` (the same string as `code`, named for the form field it goes
in) and `number`, the counter that solved it. CaptchaFox and Friendly Captcha add
`token`, the same string as `code`; CaptchaFox also reports `userAgent`, the UA
the browser minted the token under.

Capy returns an object rather than a token, expanded into `captchakey`,
`challengekey` and `answer` — the three fields the target form takes — while
`code` keeps the raw answer.

AWS WAF returns an object too, expanded into `captcha_voucher` and
`existing_token` — the pair the site's `voucher` endpoint trades for the
`aws-waf-token` cookie — while `code` keeps the raw answer.

DataDome adds `cookie`, the `datadome=...` pair alone, while `code` keeps the
cookie with its attributes; it also carries `userAgent`, and `proxy` when
CapSkip chose the proxy.

hCaptcha adds `token`, the same string as `code`, `respKey` (always present,
empty when the widget handed out none) and `userAgent`.

MTCaptcha adds `token`, the same string as `code`.

GeeTest additionally expands its answer into `challenge`, `validate`, and
`seccode`, while `code` keeps the raw JSON string.

## Error handling

```php
use CapSkip\CapSkip;
use CapSkip\Exceptions\ValidationException;
use CapSkip\Exceptions\NetworkException;
use CapSkip\Exceptions\ApiException;
use CapSkip\Exceptions\TimeoutException;

try {
    $result = $solver->recaptcha('...', '...');
} catch (ValidationException $e) {
    // invalid parameters
} catch (NetworkException $e) {
    // CapSkip not running, or captcha not ready (manual polling)
} catch (ApiException $e) {
    // API returned an error code
} catch (TimeoutException $e) {
    // polling timeout exceeded
}
```

All four extend `CapSkip\Exceptions\CapSkipError`, so you can catch them all at once with the base class.

## FAQ

### How do I solve a captcha in PHP?

Install the CapSkip desktop app, `composer require capskip/capskip`, then call the method that matches the widget — `recaptcha()`, `turnstile()`, `geetest()`, `altcha()`, `capy()`, `captchafox()`, `friendlyCaptcha()`, `amazonWaf()`, `dataDome()`, `hcaptcha()`, `mtcaptcha()` or `normal()`. Each one blocks until CapSkip has an answer, then returns a token (a cookie for DataDome), or the recognized text in the case of an image captcha.

### Is this a free captcha solver?

The SDK itself is MIT-licensed and free. Solving needs the CapSkip app, which is bought once rather than metered per captcha, so your cost stops scaling with volume.

### Which captchas can it solve?

reCAPTCHA v2 (checkbox and invisible), reCAPTCHA v3, reCAPTCHA Enterprise, Cloudflare Turnstile, GeeTest v3, ALTCHA, Capy Puzzle, CaptchaFox, Friendly Captcha, AWS WAF, DataDome, hCaptcha (including invisible and Enterprise), MTCaptcha, and image/text captchas. Not FunCaptcha/Arkose.

### Does it work with Laravel, Guzzle or Symfony?

Yes — see [above](#laravel-guzzle-and-symfony-panther). The SDK has no framework ties and depends only on `ext-curl` and `ext-json`, so it drops into any PHP 8 project.

### Why is my reCAPTCHA v3 score low?

Google derives v3 scores from IP reputation, cookies and browsing history. A solver returns a valid token, but it cannot change how Google grades that token — `score` is forwarded as the target you want, not a guarantee. If a site enforces a high threshold, solve through a cleaner IP using the `proxy` option.

### Can I use it as a 2captcha alternative?

Yes. CapSkip serves the same endpoints, so you can either move to this SDK or repoint an existing 2captcha client at `127.0.0.1:8080`.

### Does the captcha have to be on a public page?

For widget captchas, yes — CapSkip loads the URL you pass it. Image captchas only need the image, and that can be a local file.

### Will a long solve time out my PHP request?

It can. A reCAPTCHA solve takes tens of seconds, which is longer than most `max_execution_time` settings and longer than a user will wait on a page load. Solve from a queue worker or CLI script rather than inside a web request.
