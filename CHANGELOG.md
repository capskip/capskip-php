# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-11-10

### Added

- **MTCaptcha support** via `mtcaptcha(string $sitekey, string $url, array $options = [])`
  on `CapSkip` (and so on `AsyncCapSkip`), following 2Captcha's signature. It
  sends `method=mt_captcha`.
- Optional parameters: `action` (the action the page's `mtcaptchaConfig` sets),
  `userAgent` / `useragent`, and `proxy`. `pageurl` is accepted for `$url`.
- The result carries the token, `v1(...)`, as both `code` and `token`, for the
  form's `mtcaptcha-verifiedtoken` field.

### Changed

- The README's desktop-app download link now points to
  <https://capskip.com/download-capskip/> instead of the `.msi` file.

### Notes

- Refused locally, before a round-trip: a missing sitekey or one that is not
  `MTPublic-` followed by letters, digits, `-` or `_` (64 characters at most), a
  page URL that is missing or not an absolute http(s) address, and any parameter
  the CapSkip MTCaptcha API does not take. An `sk=` prefix, as MTCaptcha's own
  `getchallenge` request writes the key, is stripped.
- MTCaptcha uses `defaultTimeout`: no browser runs for the solve.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **hCaptcha support** via `hcaptcha(string $sitekey, string $url, array $options = [])`
  on `CapSkip` (and so `AsyncCapSkip`), following 2Captcha's `hcaptcha(sitekey,
  pageurl, ...)`. Checkbox, invisible and hCaptcha Enterprise widgets all use
  this one method; `pageurl` in `$options` is accepted in place of `$url`.
- Optional parameters: `invisible` (`1` or `true` for an invisible widget),
  `data` (the Enterprise `rqdata`), `userAgent` / `useragent`, and `proxy`.
- The result carries the token as both `code` and `token`, `respKey` (always
  present, empty when the widget handed out none) and `userAgent`, the
  User-Agent the token was earned with. Polled results now carry a `respKey`
  field whenever the server sends one.

### Notes

- Refused locally, before a round-trip: a missing sitekey, a page URL that is
  missing or not an absolute http(s) address, an `invisible` value other than
  0/1/true/false, and any parameter the CapSkip hCaptcha API does not take
  (2Captcha's `domain` among them).
- `invisible` is sent as `1`, or left out when off, so a PHP `false` never
  reaches the server as `0` and a string such as `"TRUE"` is sent the way the
  server reads it.
- hCaptcha uses `recaptchaTimeout`: the widget is passed in a real browser.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- **DataDome support** via `dataDome(string $captchaUrl, string $url, array $options = [])`
  on both `CapSkip` and `AsyncCapSkip`, sent as `method=datadome`, covering both
  DataDome challenges: the slider (`/captcha/`) and the device check
  (`/interstitial/`). The order is 2Captcha's `datadome(captcha_url, pageurl,
  userAgent, proxy)`, with `userAgent` and `proxy` optional entries in
  `$options`; PHP method names are case-insensitive, so `datadome()` resolves
  too.
- The result carries the cookie twice: `code` exactly as DataDome set it,
  attributes included, and `cookie`, the `datadome=...` pair alone for a Cookie
  header. `userAgent` is the User-Agent the cookie was earned with, the one sent
  or CapSkip's own browser's.
- `proxy` in the result: when a task is sent without a proxy and the CapSkip app
  solves it through its own DataDome proxy list, the result names that proxy as
  `host:port`. The cookie only works from that address, so it is reported
  rather than dropped. Polled results now carry a `proxy` field whenever the
  server sends one.
- Parameter aliases `captchaUrl` / `captchaURL` for `captcha_url`.

### Notes

- Refused locally, before a round-trip: a missing `captcha_url` or `pageurl`; a
  `captcha_url` that is not an https challenge address on captcha-delivery.com
  carrying `initialCid`, `hash` and `cid`; a block page that bans the
  requesting address (`t=bv`); a `pageurl` that is not http(s); and a
  `userAgent` that is not stock Chrome for Windows. CapSkip itself checks that
  the Chrome major version matches its browser and answers
  `ERROR_WRONG_USERAGENT` when it does not.
- An optional passed as `''` is dropped like `null`, since the server treats an
  empty value as absent.
- DataDome uses `recaptchaTimeout`: the challenge is passed in a real browser.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-11-01

### Added

- **AWS WAF support** via `amazonWaf(string $sitekey, string $url, array $options = [])`
  on both `CapSkip` and `AsyncCapSkip`, sent as `method=amazon_waf`. On a
  challenge page `$sitekey` is `gokuProps.key`, with optional `iv` and `context`
  (`gokuProps.iv` / `.context`, both or neither) and the `challenge_script` /
  `captcha_script` URLs; on a widget page `$sitekey` is the widget's `apiKey` and
  `jsapiScript` the URL of `jsapi.js`.
  The answer is **not a token**: the result expands into `captcha_voucher` and
  `existing_token`, the pair the site's `voucher` endpoint (beside
  `challenge.js`) trades for the `aws-waf-token` cookie. `code` keeps the raw
  answer.
- Parameter aliases `challengeScript` for `challenge_script`, `captchaScript` for
  `captcha_script`, and `jsapi_script` for `jsapiScript`.

### Changed

- The Capy answer expansion now goes through a shared helper that AWS WAF uses
  too. Capy results are unchanged.
- `CapSkip::VERSION` now reports `1.4.0`; it had been left at `1.2.0` in the
  1.3.0 release.

### Notes

- Refused locally, before a round-trip: a missing `sitekey` or `pageurl`, a
  `pageurl` that is not an absolute http/https URL, `iv` without `context` (or
  the reverse), and any script URL that is not https on an `awswaf.com` host
  ending in `challenge.js`, `captcha.js` or `jsapi.js`. CapSkip POSTs the solution
  to the host the script names, so it refuses anything that is not an AWS WAF
  integration.
- An optional passed as `''` is dropped like `null`, since the server treats an
  empty value as absent.
- AWS WAF uses `recaptchaTimeout`: a real browser mints the token the voucher is
  issued for.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- **Capy Puzzle support** via `capy(string $sitekey, string $url, array $options = [])`
  on both `CapSkip` and `AsyncCapSkip`. The site key (conventionally prefixed
  `PUZZLE_`) is sent as the `captchakey` the API documents. Optional `api_server`
  selects the Capy API the key lives behind, defaulting to
  `https://jp.api.capy.me`.
  A Capy answer is **not a token**: the result expands into `captchakey`,
  `challengekey` and `answer`, which go into the target form's `capy_captchakey`,
  `capy_challengekey` and `capy_answer` fields. `code` keeps the raw answer.
- **CaptchaFox support** via `captchafox(string $sitekey, string $url, array $options = [])`.
  The result exposes `token` (for the form's `cf-captcha-response` field) and,
  when the solve reported one, `userAgent` — the UA the browser actually minted
  the token under, which is not the one you sent. Optional `api_server` selects
  the widget source; the MAM package returns a `MAM_` prefixed token.
- **Friendly Captcha support** via `friendlyCaptcha(string $sitekey, string $url, array $options = [])`.
  Pass `version` (`v1`/`v2`, or a bare `1`/`2`), or `module_script` /
  `nomodule_script` with the widget script URLs and let CapSkip read the version
  off the build the site actually loads. Optional `api_server` accepts `global`
  (the default), `eu`, or a full URL for the data-residency tenant. The result
  exposes `token`, for `frc-captcha-solution` on v1 or `frc-captcha-response` on
  v2.
- Parameter aliases `userAgent`/`user_agent` for `useragent`, `captchaKey` for
  `captchakey`, and `moduleScript`/`nomoduleScript` for `module_script` /
  `nomodule_script`.

### Notes

- `'version' => 'avatar'` is refused locally for Capy. CapSkip solves the puzzle
  family only, and answering an avatar request with a puzzle answer would bill
  for a solve the target site rejects, indistinguishably from a broken solver.
- An unknown Friendly Captcha `version` is refused locally too. The two versions
  are different protocols sharing one sitekey namespace, so solving the wrong one
  returns a well-formed token the site rejects with nothing to indicate why.
- CaptchaFox and Friendly Captcha use `recaptchaTimeout`: the first is a real
  browser solve, and the second has its difficulty set per request by the service
  (and always solves in a browser on v2). Capy uses `defaultTimeout` — it is one
  HTTP fetch plus pixel math, held back to roughly two seconds because Capy
  refuses answers that arrive faster than a human could have produced them.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- **ALTCHA support** via `altcha($url, $options)` on both `CapSkip` and
  `AsyncCapSkip`. Pass `challenge_url` for CapSkip to fetch the challenge, or
  `challenge_json` with the document itself (a JSON string, or an array which is
  serialized for you). Sending both is allowed — the inline document wins. The
  result exposes `token` (the value the site's `altcha` form field expects) and
  `number`, the counter that solved it; `code` keeps the same raw string.
- Parameter aliases `challengeUrl`/`challengeURL` for `challenge_url` and
  `challengeJson`/`challengeJSON` for `challenge_json`.
- Both ALTCHA generations are handled: the legacy scheme (SHA-1/256/384/512) and
  proof-of-work v2 (PBKDF2 or SHA). Their tokens are shaped differently — a v2
  payload carries no top-level `number`, its counter sitting at
  `solution.counter` — so the counter is taken from the server's own `solution`
  object, the one field both report the same way, and dug out of the token only
  when a poll did not carry it.

### Notes

- ALTCHA is CPU proof-of-work rather than a browser solve, so it uses
  `defaultTimeout` instead of the longer `recaptchaTimeout` that reCAPTCHA,
  Turnstile and GeeTest use.
- A proxy passed to `altcha()` applies only to the `challenge_url` fetch; a task
  carrying its challenge inline never touches the network.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **GeeTest v3 (slide) support** via `geetest(string $gt, string $challenge, string $url, array $options = [])`
  on both `CapSkip` and `AsyncCapSkip`. Accepts the optional `api_server` domain
  override and the usual `proxy` option. The result exposes the answer as the
  parsed `challenge`, `validate`, and `seccode` keys, while `code` keeps the raw
  JSON string CapSkip returns.
- Parameter aliases `apiServer` and `api_subdomain` for `api_server`.
- `proxytype` is now validated against the values CapSkip accepts (`HTTP`,
  `HTTPS`, `SOCKS5`, `SOCKS5H`, case-insensitive) for every proxy-capable captcha
  type. `SOCKS4` and other values previously reached the server and came back as
  `ERROR_BAD_PARAMETERS`; they now raise `ValidationException` locally.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Version aligned with the CapSkip Python and Node.js SDKs, which ship the
  json-submit fix as 1.0.2. No functional changes to the PHP SDK since 1.0.1,
  which already carried both the empty-body and json-submit fixes.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Polling no longer crashes with `ApiException: cannot recognize response` when
  CapSkip returns an empty response body. CapSkip returns an empty body while no
  result is available yet — briefly right after a captcha is submitted (before it
  reports `CAPCHA_NOT_READY`), for an unknown id, and after a solved token has
  already been read. The SDK now treats an empty body as "not ready" and keeps
  polling, so `recaptcha()`, `turnstile()`, and `normal()` solve reliably instead
  of failing on the first poll.
- Submitting with `json=1` no longer fails with `ApiException: cannot recognize
  response`. With `json=1` CapSkip's `in.php` returns `{"status":1,"request":"<id>"}`
  instead of `OK|<id>`; `send()` now parses both forms, so `normal(..., ['json' => 1])`
  and the equivalent reCAPTCHA/Turnstile calls submit and solve correctly.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Initial release of the CapSkip PHP SDK
- `CapSkip` client for the local CapSkip API
- `AsyncCapSkip` / `AsyncApiClient` exported as aliases for cross-SDK parity
  (PHP executes synchronously)
- Image CAPTCHA solving via `normal()` (file, URL, base64, or data-URI)
- reCAPTCHA v2 / v3 solving via `recaptcha()` (invisible, enterprise, proxy)
- Cloudflare Turnstile solving via `turnstile()` (widget and challenge page)
- Turnstile automatically polls with `json=1` and returns `userAgent` when provided
- Manual workflow: `send()`, `getResult()`, `solve()`
- Adaptive result polling — starts at 0.25s and backs off (doubling) up to the
  configured `pollingInterval`, so fast solves (e.g. image captchas) return in a
  fraction of a second; `pollingInterval` also accepts sub-second (float) values
- Familiar parameter aliases (`url`→`pageurl`, `score`→`min_score`, etc.)
- Proxy support via array format `['type' => '...', 'uri' => '...']`
- Strict per-captcha parameter validation — only documented parameters are accepted
- Exception hierarchy: `ValidationException`, `NetworkException`, `ApiException`, `TimeoutException`
- Zero runtime dependencies — built on the `curl` and `json` extensions
- Example scripts for every supported captcha type
- Unit and integration tests (PHPUnit) with a mocked API client and a local mock server
- Documentation: Tutorial, Getting Started, API Reference, Troubleshooting
